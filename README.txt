This project is the odin-recipes project designed to learn the basics
of HTML. As I am already familiar with HTML, I will primarily use this
project to practice using Git and getting accustomed to the proper
workflow and git commits, as well as a refresher/review of HTML basics. 
By the end of this project I hope to have a better grasp of the git
workflow.
