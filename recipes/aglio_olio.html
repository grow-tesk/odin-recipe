        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Translating from the Italian to Garlic and Oil, Aglio e
                Olio is an incredibly simple pasta recipe that nevertheless 
                is full of rich, garlicy flavor. 
            </p>
        <h2>Ingedients</h2>
            <p>Serves 2, or 1 if you're especially hungry</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>~ 4 to 5 oz of either spaghetti or angel hair pasta</li>
                    <li>~ 5 to 7 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
                    <li>~ 1/4 cup of finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano plus extra 
                        for serving</li>
                    <li>A pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
                    <li>~ 1/8 up of chopped parsley (optional but highly 
                        reccomended, as the fresh bitterness of the parsely 
                        balances the richness of the garlic-infused oil and parmesan)</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
                <h3>For the garlic and oil:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Add sliced oil, garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) to 
                            a cold saute pan and place on medium-low heat.
                        </li>
                        <li>When the oil begins to bubble, turn heat to low and allow garlic
                            to simmer.</li>
                            <li>
                            When the very edges of the garlic begin to turn golden, remove 
                            the pan from the heat. Keep a vigilant eye on the garlic, as it 
                            can burn easily. If burning occurs, it is strongly reccomended to start 
                            over with fresh garlic and oil, as burnt garlic will make the dish taste acrid.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>For the pasta:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.</li>
                        <li>When at a roiling boil, add pasta of choice, and cook unil al-dente.</li>
                        <li>Drain pasta, reserving a bit of the water beforehand.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>To finish:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Put pasta into the oil and toss. Add 1/4 cup of parmesan and reserved
                            pasta water and continue to toss. The goal is to coat the pasta with
                            the oil and parmesan.
                        </li>
                        <li>To serve, portion pasta onto a plate, and add extra parmesan and 
                            chopped parsely if desired.</li>
                    </ol>
