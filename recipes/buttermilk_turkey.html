        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hands down the best Thanksgiving turkey I have ever had. I don't know this for certain,
        but I would hazard a guess that turkey, the ostensible centerpiece of any proper Thanksgiving meal,
        is down toward the bottom of most peoples' ranking of their favorite Thanksgiving dishes. And 
        who can blame them? Most of the time turkey served at the Thanksgiving table, goodlooking though 
        it may appear, is so often dry and flavorless. Why go to all the effort to chew a dry turkey breast
        when buttery mashed potatoes are right there? Most accept a tiny slice of meat, praying for a piece of
        dark, and then prioritize stuffing themselves with well... the stuffing. No longer. Though it requires 
        a few days ahead-of-time prep, and the spatchcocking method will not yeild the round turkey Rockwell would deign to paint, 
        the moist, flavorful turkey that results (and, thanks to the aforementioned spatchcocking, cooks in half
        the time), is more than worth it. I cannot reccomend this recipe enough.
            </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Yield:10 to 14 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1(10- to 14-pound) turkey</li>
            <li>3quarts buttermilk</li>
            <li>128grams fine sea salt (about 7 tablespoons)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Two to three days before you plan to cook, spatchcock the turkey: Put the turkey on a stable 
                cutting board, breast-side down, and use heavy-duty kitchen shears to snip along both sides 
                of the backbone to release it. You can start from the tail or neck end, whichever you prefer; 
                just keep the blades of the scissors as close to the spine as possible. It helps to work 
                incrementally, snipping a little on one side, then a little on the other, rather than 
                completing one side entirely and then doing the second side without the advantage of the 
                opposing pressure.
            </li>
            <li>
                After removing the backbone, remove wingtips, neck and giblets, setting them all aside for 
                stock and gravy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn turkey over so breast faces up. Splay out its legs and press hard on breastbone until 
                you hear the cartilage pop and the bird lies completely flat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a 2-gallon resealable bag in a large bowl, stock pot or sink. Pour buttermilk and 
                salt in bag and stir to dissolve salt. Place turkey in bag and seal carefully, expelling 
                out air. Double-bag the turkey as needed to prevent leakage, then squish the inner bag 
                to distribute buttermilk all around the turkey. Place it on a rimmed baking sheet and 
                refrigerate for 48 hours. Turn the bag every 12 hours so that every part of the turkey 
                gets marinated. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Three hours before you plan to start cooking, remove the turkey from the plastic bag and 
                scrape off as much buttermilk as you can without being obsessive, discarding buttermilk. 
                Set the turkey on a rimmed baking sheet and bring it to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and heat to 400 degrees. Transfer turkey, 
                breast-side up, to another rimmed baking sheet lined with a wire rack or parchment paper. 
                Tuck thighs inward.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place baking sheet on the prepared oven rack and roast the turkey, occasionally rotating 
                the pan 180 degrees, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of 
                the breast registers 150 degrees and the thickest part of the thigh without touching bone 
                registers 165 degrees, about 80 to 100 minutes, depending on size. (You may want to tent 
                the breast or other hot spots with aluminum foil, if darkening too quickly.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer turkey to a cutting board or platter and allow to rest at least 20 minutes before 
                carving.
            </li>
        </ol>
